# Advanced Node and Express

This is based on the boilerplate for the Advanced Node and Express lessons. Instructions for the lessons start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/

To use this project, you can clone the project, then rename the sample.env file

From there you will want to replace the SESSION_SECRET with some random numbers and replace the MONGO_URI with an actual URI from a Mongo Project. You should be able to create a free project with an M0 cluster that can provide the database for this project.

If you are having issues setting up a free database on MongoDB Atlas, check out this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/get-started-with-mongodb-atlas/).
